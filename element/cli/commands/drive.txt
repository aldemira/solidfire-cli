                        SecureEraseDrives enables you to remove any residual data from drives that have a status of "available." You might want to use this method when replacing a drive nearing the end of its service life that contained sensitive data. This method uses a Security Erase Unit command to write a predetermined pattern to the drive and resets the encryption key on the drive. This asynchronous method might take up to two minutes to complete. You can use GetAsyncResult to check on the status of the secure erase operation. You can use the ListDrives method to obtain the driveIDs for the drives you want to secure erase.

                        You can use RemoveDrives to proactively remove drives that are part of the cluster. You might want to use this method when reducing cluster capacity or preparing to replace drives nearing the end of their service life. Any data on the drives is removed and migrated to other drives in the cluster before the drive is removed from the cluster. This is an asynchronous method. Depending on the total capacity of the drives being removed, it might take several minutes to migrate all of the data. Use the GetAsyncResult method to check the status of the remove operation. When removing multiple drives, use a single RemoveDrives method call rather than multiple individual methods with a single drive each. This reduces the amount of data balancing that must occur to even stabilize the storage load on the cluster. You can also remove drives with a "failed" status using RemoveDrives. When you remove a drive with a "failed" status it is not returned to an "available" or active status. The drive is unavailable for use in the cluster. Use the ListDrives method to obtain the driveIDs for the drives you want to remove.

                        AddDrives enables you to add one or more available drives to the cluster, enabling the drives to host a portion of the cluster's data. When you add a node to the cluster or install new drives in an existing node, the new drives are marked as "available" and must be added via AddDrives before they can be utilized. Use the ListDrives method to display drives that are "available" to be added. When you add multiple drives, it is more efficient to add them in a single AddDrives method call rather than multiple individual methods with a single drive each. This reduces the amount of data balancing that must occur to stabilize the storage load on the cluster. When you add a drive, the system automatically determines the "type" of drive it should be. The method is asynchronous and returns immediately. However, it can take some time for the data in the cluster to be rebalanced using the newly added drives. As the new drives are syncing on the system, you can use the ListSyncJobs method to see how the drives are being rebalanced and the progress of adding the new drive. You can also use the GetAsyncResult method to query the method's returned asyncHandle.
